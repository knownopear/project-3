## Back-End Conclusions
### What I've Learnt
* Every layer of looping increases difficulty exponentially
* Good planning leads to clarity (..ERD)
* Don't sidetrack from the MVP

### Points I'd like to touch on
* Importance of the ERD
* Clear thinking
* No-harm-in-trying
* Communication is key; talking is not communication
---
## Front-End Project Learnings and Conclusion
* Importance of proper planning with initial drafts to enable clearer understanding, development and execution to make the necessary revisions rather than unfocused, random changes.
* Vital to involve team member and provide constant updates on status, issues encountered to avoid unnecessary rework.
* Importance of time management to focus on the objectives and deliverables in a timely manner.
